# missile-jet-engagement-sim
[ALL RIGHTS RESERVED] 3D physics-based simulation of a guided missile intercepting a fighter jet, using simplified 6-DOF/3-DOF dynamics, classical guidance laws (Pure Pursuit, Proportional Navigation), and basic 3D visualization, with room to add AI-based guidance later.
